    "The [Setun Computer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Setun) was a computer built in the Soviet Union in 1958 by Ukrainian computer scientist [Nikolay Brusentsov](http://en.uacomputing.com/persons/brusentsov/).  It used *ternary* logic rather than binary.  In Brusentov's own words: ''Computer science cannot limit itself to the universally-accepted binary system; the base should be ternary''.  He argued that ternary logic was a better representation of the way humans think; unfortunately for him, it never caught on."

    "  \n",
    "4. Because $a_0$ can vary, the leading trit must be explicitly stored.  This is not the case with normalized binary systems.  That's also why we stopped at $a_{n-1}$ instead of going to $a_n$.  In binary, we get one extra bit of precision because we don't need to store the leading one."
